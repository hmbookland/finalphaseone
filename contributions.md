Anna created the base code, csv export, and ran individual statistics outputs. 
She based her work off of the PDF that was initially provided as the requirements for the final. 
It was only have many hours of work that Nick pointed out that the reqs have been updated in the module. 
Anna also created some histograms which were not used.

Nick cleaned up the code to meet the updated requirements (for example, using "describe" instead of each individual stat). 
As data visualization is his professional, we selected him to to the charts.
His looked better than Anna's, so we are submitting his. He compiled our work into the Jupyter notebook.
